# I'm Using GitHub Under Protest

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a proprietary,  
trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software (FOSS).  
I am deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub to develop my FOSS project.  
I urge you to read about the
[Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign from
[the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org)  
to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done without my permission.  
I do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's code in Copilot.

I plan to move this project to another hosting site (TBD) and will leave a link to it here in this README file.
